Edward sailed from the River Orwell on 22 June and encountered the French blocking his way to Sluys harbour. The French bound their ships into three lines, forming large floating fighting platforms. The English fleet spent some time manoeuvring to gain the advantage of wind and tide. During this delay the French ships were driven to the east of their starting positions and became entangled with each other. Béhuchet and Quiéret ordered the ships to be separated and the fleet attempted to move back to the west, against the wind and the tide. While the French were in this disorganised state the English attacked.

The English were able to manoeuvre against the French and defeat them in detail, capturing most of their ships. The French lost 16,000&ndash;20,000 men killed, against 400&ndash;600 for the English. The battle gave the English fleet naval supremacy in the English Channel.

ABRAHAM: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON: I do bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON [Aside to GREGORY]: Is the law of our side, if I say
ay?

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

## Horizontal Rules

---

## Math

A big subset of LaTeX works inside `$...$` or `$$...$$` via
[KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html), both as 
inline $\int_0^1 x \left[ \cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) \right]dx = {1\over 2}$ 
and display:
$$\lim_{x\downarrow 0}\, x\ln x = 0$$

## Emphasis

**Bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes can be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than 
>> signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`, or block code fences:

```
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

## Tables
